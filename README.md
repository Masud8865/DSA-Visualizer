# 🚀 DSA Visualizer

### "Stop memorizing code. Start seeing it."

Welcome to **DSA Visualizer**, an interactive, open-source platform designed to bridge the gap between theoretical algorithm logic and practical implementation. This project is built to help the global community of students and developers master Data Structures and Algorithms through immersive, real-time animations.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **Real-time Visualization:** Watch algorithms work step-by-step with intuitive color-coding for comparisons (Yellow), swaps (Red), and sorted elements (Green).
* **Total Playback Control:** A custom-built state engine allowing users to **Start, Pause, Resume, and Reset** animations at any point.
* **Dual Learning Experience:** Every visualizer is paired with a clean, standard **C++ Implementation** scrollable directly below the animation.
* **Cinematic UI:** A fully responsive, dark-mode dashboard designed for focus and clarity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React.js** – Modern frontend architecture.
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for a sleek, custom UI.
* **Framer Motion** – High-performance layout animations for the visualizer bars.
* **Lucide React** – Clean and consistent iconography.
* **React Router DOM** – Seamless navigation between Home, Algorithms, and Contact pages.
